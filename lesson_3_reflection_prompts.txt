When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

>git remote add origin <githubURL>	# to sync a local repository to one on github
>git remote -v				# check remote repository that has been sync'd
>git push origin master			# push local repository to github
>git pull origin master			# pull changes made directly on github to local repo

* Remote repository e.g. on github.com is useful for cloud backups of source code files and other assets

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

* Pull syncs changes made directly on github to local repo,
Should be extremely careful while pulling changes to local repo.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

* Fork -> Cloning another user's repo on github
* Clone -> Copying a remote repo on github to local machine
* Branch -> Creating another version of the master branch

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

* Useful for fetching and merging code from collaborators while making independent changes
to local repo

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

* Very difficult to collaborate without git or github since changes have to be tracked
and done manually while communicating with collaborators

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? 
What benefits does each approach have?

* While working on a collaborative project, modifications could be done on a separate
branch which is vetted before the owner merges them on the master branch.
This keeps the master branch separate until all changes have been checked and finalized.
